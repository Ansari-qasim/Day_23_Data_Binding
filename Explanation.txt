What is Data Binding in Angular?
Data binding means connecting the data in your TypeScript (logic) with what shows up in the HTML (the user interface).

There are four types:

Interpolation: Shows the value from the component on the screen.

Property Binding: Changes element properties like whether a button is disabled or not.

Event Binding: Reacts to things users do, like clicks.

Two-Way Binding: Keeps the data in sync both ways â€” when the user types something, it updates the logic, and if the logic changes, it updates the input too.

Standalone Component (Optional Explanation)
Instead of using an extra module file (like app.module.ts), you're using a newer Angular method where each component can manage its own setup. It's cleaner for small projects or learning purposes.
